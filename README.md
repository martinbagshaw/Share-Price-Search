## Challenge
- Use the publicly available API at [Finn Hub](https://finnhub.io/docs/api#stock-candles)
- The SPA should display the selected date range, the company name
and the minimum, maximum and average share price over the selected
week.
- The weekly date range should be set through a date picker and default
to the last 7 days (inclusive of the current day).
- The user should be provided with a mechanism to enter/select a
company and retrieve its share data.
- The API contains other endpoints (e.g. News &amp; Basic Financials). You
may use these to add additional features to your application.

## User Story

- I can view basic stock information on a selected company
- So that I can make a decision on what stock to buy
