Develop a simple Single Page Application (SPA) that allows a user to
retrieve a weeksâ€™ worth of historical share price data for a specified
company.

## Challenge
- Use the publicly available API at Finn Hub (https://finnhub.io/docs/api#
stock-candles)
- The SPA should display the selected date range, the company name
and the minimum, maximum and average share price over the selected
week.
- The weekly date range should be set through a date picker and default
to the last 7 days (inclusive of the current day).
- The user should be provided with a mechanism to enter/select a
company and retrieve its share data.
- The API contains other endpoints (e.g. News &amp; Basic Financials). You
may use these to add additional features to your application.

## User Story
- As a user running the system
- I can view basic stock information on a selected company
- So that I can make a decision on what stock to buy

## Instructions
- Spend as much or as little time on the exercise as you like.
- Use whatever UI frameworks / libraries / packages you like.
- Try to consider good development practices and think how it could be
extended (i.e. scalability / infrastructure best practice)
- Your code should compile and run in one step.
- All stories to be completed with an appropriate level of testing.
- If submitting a zip file, please avoid including artefacts from your local build
(such as ./node_modules or ./build folders) in your final .zip.
- We will review and consider ALL aspects of the code you submit including the
HTML mark-up and CSS.

## Extra
Please answer the following questions in a markdown file called Answers to
technical questions.md. We will discuss them further if you come in for a face
to face interview.
- How long did you spend on the coding challenge?
- What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn&#39;t spend
much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what
you would add.
- What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your
chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you&#39;ve
used it.
- How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you
ever had to do this?
